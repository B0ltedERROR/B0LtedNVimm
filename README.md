I'm creating this becasue when looking at the keymap setup of motions and actions, it didn't seem intuitive for my exclusive experience of gaming hotkey setup. Couple of examples being that movement always being in the wasd format, larger jumps in movement should be around that left hand cluster. 

Basic idealogical structure should be that left hand is in charge of movement/highlighting text, and right hand should be in charge of modification, macros, and cut/paste.

I am by no means saying that this is the best config and my experience comes from hotkeys in the RTS, MOBA, and FPS genre.
